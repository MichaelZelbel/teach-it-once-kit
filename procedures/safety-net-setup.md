# The Safety Net (Chapter 18)

Three prompts and one small piece of homework. Total time, about four
minutes. You type no commands at any point.

Two nets, and they fail in opposite directions:

- **Undo** catches the ordinary disaster, a good file quietly turning into
  a worse file.
- **A copy that is not on this laptop** catches the coffee, the theft, and
  the drive that stops one morning.

You want both.

## Net one: version history

In a session with your folder attached:

```
Set up version history for this folder so I can undo my mistakes.
I do not want to type any commands. Explain in plain words what you
did when you are done.
```

It will ask permission before running anything. Say yes.

What you should see afterwards: a first snapshot covering every file, a
hidden `.git` folder you never have to open, and (if your house rules from
Chapter 17 are installed) a new row in `procedures.md`, because anything
that runs on its own gets written down.

## Using the undo, in plain words

You never type a command again. You say things like:

```
Show me what has changed since yesterday.
```

```
Undo the last change to .claude/skills/plan-my-day/SKILL.md.
```

```
I let something overwrite profile/voice.md and it is now three useless
lines. Put it back the way it was, and show me what you restored.
```

```
Roll the whole folder back to the initial version.
```

## Your homework, the only step you cannot hand over

GitHub needs an account and signing in to your own account is not
something an assistant can do for you. Make one at **github.com**. Free.
That is the whole of it.

## Net two: a private copy off this laptop

```
Now put a private backup copy of this folder on GitHub, so my work
survives if this laptop dies. It must be private. Call it hub-backup.
I do not want to type any commands. Tell me the web address when it
is done.
```

Then open the web address it gives you and check with your own eyes that
the word **Private** sits next to the name. Once, today. Your folder holds
your people, your projects and your voice; this is not the place to assume.

A backup made once is a backup of last Tuesday. Keep it current with:

```
Save a snapshot and push the private copy.
```

Or ask for it at the end of every session, which makes it a procedure, and
procedures get a row in `procedures.md`.

## Net three, optional: a window onto the same folder

Your system is plain text files, so any program that reads text files can
be a second window onto it. **Obsidian** (obsidian.md, free for personal
use) is the one worth trying.

On its start screen, under **Create local vault**, choose:

> **Open folder as vault**
> Choose an existing folder of Markdown files.

Pick your folder. That is the entire setup. A "vault" is a folder.

Two notes. Obsidian starts in **Restricted mode**, with community add-ons
off; leave it that way. And this net is genuinely optional. Nothing later
in the book needs it.

## What you can now survive

- A file quietly ruined: undone in a sentence.
- A change you regret from three days ago: undone in a sentence.
- A laptop that dies on a Tuesday: everything is one download away, and
  it is private.
- A tidy-up that went too far: red line 3 stopped it, and the snapshot
  catches whatever the rules did not.
