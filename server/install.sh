# Teach It Once - the always-on server, in one line.
#
# Chapters 28 and 29 of the book. This puts your folder on a machine that never
# sleeps, runs Hermes there as a service that starts with the machine, connects
# your Telegram bot to it, and puts the morning brief on Hermes' own clock.
#
# On the server you just rented, logged in as root, paste this:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelZelbel/teach-it-once-kit/main/server/install.sh | bash
#
# It is safe to run twice. Nothing here deletes anything.
#
# What it does on its own, first as root and then as your assistant's account:
#   - installs what the machine is missing (git, curl, xz, jq, the GitHub tool)
#   - makes a separate account for your assistant, so it is never root
#   - installs Hermes for that account, tells it where your folder will be,
#     connects a Telegram bot of yours to it (one token pasted, one "hi" from
#     your phone; the id is read from the bot's own message log), and installs
#     its gateway as a system service (root's one job, done once)
#   - signs Hermes in to your ChatGPT account with a code you type on any device
#   - fetches your folder from GitHub, or starts a fresh one and creates its
#     private GitHub repository (a code again in either case)
#   - wires the folder exactly the way the laptop installer does, proves Hermes
#     can read it, and, if you say yes, puts the morning brief on Hermes' clock
#   - puts a watchdog on the machine's own clock (server/install-watchdog.sh):
#     a plain check that restarts a dead gateway, a second Hermes on the same
#     sign-in that reads the logs four times a day and reports to Telegram,
#     and a half-hourly proof that the second Hermes can still answer
#
# What it asks you: a Telegram bot token (Enter skips); whether a repository
# already holds your folder, and for a fresh hub what its new private repository
# should be called; whether to connect Menerio (optional); whether to put the
# morning brief on the clock (opt-in). Plus two codes. What only you can do
# afterwards: paste server/open-the-door.sh, then point the Hermes app on your
# computer at the server (Chapter 29).
#
# The by-hand version of all of this is in server/setup.md, for when something
# breaks and you want to know what it did.
# =============================================================================

# Not `set -e`: the shared primitives report a failure and return, and a

# --- Telegram, from one token --------------------------------------------------
# Hermes switches Telegram on by itself when TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN is in its env file
# (gateway/config_env.py, the credential-gated enable), reads who may talk to it
# from TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USERS, and gives `hermes send -t telegram`, the morning
# brief and the watchdog their address from TELEGRAM_HOME_CHANNEL, the line that
# /sethome would otherwise write. So three lines in ~/.hermes/.env are the whole
# connection, and the reader's id comes from the bot's own message log after one
# "hi" from their phone, the way the other kits do it. No web page, no /sethome.
# Until 2026-09-06 this installer left Telegram to Chapter 29's web page, and the
# reader ended Chapter 28 with a running Hermes they could not talk to.
# The token is never printed and never logged; it only ever travels in the URL of
# a curl call whose errors are discarded.

   Your assistant needs an ear. On a server there is no screen, so the ear is a
   Telegram bot of your own: you write to it from your phone, your assistant
   answers from your folder, and the morning brief and the watchdog's alerts
   land in the same chat. Making the bot takes two minutes, on your phone:

     1. In Telegram, open the account called BotFather and send it /newbot.
     2. It asks for a display name (anything) and a username, which must end
        in "bot" and must be free. It answers with a long line of letters and
        numbers in the shape 123456789:ABCdef... That is the token, and the
        token is the bot: keep it to yourself.
     3. Paste the token here. Press Enter with nothing to skip Telegram for
        now; running this one line again asks again.

## Server watchdog

Does: keeps Hermes alive on the server. Every five minutes a plain check restarts the gateway if it died; every half hour it proves the second Hermes can answer; four times a day the second Hermes reads the logs and reports.
Rhythm: 5 min, 30 min, 6 h.       Lands: my Telegram, only when something broke or was repaired.
Lives: the machine's own clock (root's crontab), the server.
Off-switch: as root on the server, crontab -e, delete the lines between the two "teach-it-once:watchdog" markers.
Last checked: $(date +%F).

   Your assistant is running, and it has a phone number. Hermes' gateway is a
   service on this machine, working in your folder, and it comes back after a
   reboot on its own. Your bot on Telegram is its ear: write to it from
   wherever you are and it answers from your folder. Nothing more is typed
   here tonight; from now on your assistant is a chat on your phone.

  nohello) cat <<'T'

   here and your first message to the bot never arrived. Write to the bot on
   Telegram, then paste this one line again; it picks up at that step.

  *) cat <<'T'

   What is left is the book's next chapter, which puts this server on your
   desk. Only one more line is typed here.

   1. As the administrator, paste the book's second line. It puts this server
      on your private Tailscale network (make a free account at tailscale.com
      first), runs Hermes' own web page as a service, and prints the page's
      address, a username and a password:

        curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelZelbel/teach-it-once-kit/main/server/open-the-door.sh | bash

   2. Install the Hermes app on your computer. On its first screen choose
      "Connect to existing Hermes" (or later: Settings, Gateways, Remote
      gateway), give it that address, and sign in with the username and
      password from step 1. The app then works on this server, in your folder.

   A watchdog is on this machine's clock: a plain check restarts a dead
   gateway, and a second Hermes on your sign-in reads the logs four times a
   day. You hear from it on the same bot, only when something broke or was
   repaired, or when it cannot answer at all.
$(if [ "$KB_MORNING_BRIEF" = "yes" ]; then cat <<'BRIEF'

   From the next 06:00 the morning brief arrives on your bot by itself. A
   morning the gateway was down is caught up once, late, when it is back.
BRIEF
else cat <<'BRIEF'

   Nothing is on this server's clock yet. When you want the morning brief
   there, run this one line again and answer yes to that question.
