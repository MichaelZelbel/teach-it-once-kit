# Teach It Once - open a private door to the server, in one line.
#
# Chapter 29. After the one-line installer has built the server, this puts a
# private address on it (Tailscale), gives the door a username and a password,
# runs Hermes' web page as a service on that address, and checks that the page
# asks for the password. From then on the web page (messengers, jobs, settings)
# and the Hermes app on your own computer both reach the server through it.
#
# On the server, logged in as root, paste this:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelZelbel/teach-it-once-kit/main/server/open-the-door.sh | bash
#
# It is safe to run twice. Nothing here deletes anything.
#
# What it asks you: a username for the door (Enter keeps the default). What it
# shows you: one web address from Tailscale to sign in on any device, and at the
# end the server's private address and the password it made.
#
# Knobs, all optional, for a reader who knows what they want:
#   DOOR_HOST=<address>   use this address and do not touch Tailscale
#   DOOR_USER=<name>      the door's username, without asking
#   DOOR_PASSWORD=<pw>    the door's password, instead of a generated one
#   AI_USER=<account>     the assistant's account (default: ai)

   Your computer and this server need to reach each other without the rest of
   the internet listening in. Tailscale does that: a free service that gives
   each of your machines a private address only your other machines can reach.
   It needs a free account at tailscale.com, made before this step.

   The door is open, on an address only your own devices can reach.

   On your own computer, install Tailscale from tailscale.com/download and sign
   in with the same account, so your computer is on the same private network.

   In a browser: open the address above and sign in. That is Hermes' own web
   page for this server. Under Channels it connects Telegram and the other
   messengers with a form and a Restart gateway button; no typing on the server.
   Once your bot answers you, send it /sethome, so the brief and the watchdog's
   alerts know which chat is yours.

   In the Hermes app on your computer: Settings, then Gateways, then Remote
   gateway. Enter the address above as the Remote URL, press Sign in, give the
   username and password, then Save and reconnect.
