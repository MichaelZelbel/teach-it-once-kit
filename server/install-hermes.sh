# Give your assistant a phone number.
#
# Chapter 28 put your assistant on a machine that never sleeps, and it can send
# you a brief every morning. What it cannot do is hear you. This script fixes
# that. It installs Hermes, an agent that reads the same folder your assistant
# already uses and answers you on Telegram, so you can hand it a job while you
# are waiting at a bus stop.
#
# YOU PROBABLY DO NOT NEED TO RUN THIS ON ITS OWN. The one-line installer in
# this folder covers Chapters 28 and 29 together, and does everything below as
# part of it:
#
#     curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelZelbel/teach-it-once-kit/main/server/install.sh | bash
#
# This script stays for two cases: you already built the server by hand and only
# want the Hermes half, or something broke and you want to run just this part
# again. It is the same steps, in the same order.
#
# Run it as the `ai` user you made in Chapter 28, never as root:
#
#     bash install-hermes.sh
#
# It is safe to run twice. Nothing here is destructive, and every step says what
# it is doing before it does it.

# WHAT THE MACHINE NEEDS BEFORE HERMES WILL GO ON.
#
# Hermes brings almost everything with it: it downloads its own Python and its
# own package tool. Two things it cannot bring are curl and git, because they
# have to be installed by the administrator of the machine.
#
# And here is the part that catches people. Chapter 28 gave your assistant its
# own account ON PURPOSE, with no power to install software. That is the whole
# point of that account. So when the Hermes installer notices git is missing and
# tries `sudo apt install git`, it is refused, exactly as it should be. Nothing
# is broken. It just means the one apt command belongs to you, in your own
# admin account, before you run this.
say "Checking what the machine already has"

# On a normal Ubuntu server all three of these are already there, so this check
# usually just passes and you never think about it again. It exists because when
# one of them IS missing the failure is unreadable: the Hermes installer gets
# most of the way in and then prints "tar (child): xz: Cannot exec", which tells
# you nothing about what to do. One clear sentence now beats that later.

   Your assistant's account is not allowed to install software, which is correct

   Two things need answers that are yours, so this script does not guess them.

   1. Sign Hermes in to your ChatGPT subscription with a code (hermes login is
      deprecated and must not be used), or pick another AI with: $HERMES model

        $HERMES auth add openai-codex --type oauth --no-browser

   2. Connect Telegram, so it can hear you:

        $HERMES gateway setup

      Pick Telegram from the list. It offers two roads: scan a QR code with
      Telegram on your phone, or make the bot yourself with the account called
      BotFather (/newbot, two questions, paste the long token it hands you).
      Then send your new bot any message so it is allowed to answer you.

   When both are done, switch it on and ask IT how it is doing:

        $HERMES gateway start
        $HERMES gateway status

      Read the status from Hermes itself, not from systemctl: a cleanly
      stopped gateway shows as "failed" to systemd, so systemctl cannot tell
      an operator's stop from a crash.

   Then message your bot "what is in my folder?" from your phone. If it
   answers, your assistant has a phone number, and from the next morning the
   brief arrives on it by itself.
