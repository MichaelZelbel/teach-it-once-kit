# Teach It Once - the watchdog on the always-on server. Root's half.
#
# Chapter 28. The one-line installer runs this as root, after Hermes and its
# gateway service are in place and before it hands over to the assistant's
# account. It also runs alone, as root, to add the watchdog to a server built
# by hand, or to bring one up to date:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelZelbel/teach-it-once-kit/main/server/install-watchdog.sh | bash
#
# It is safe to run twice. Nothing here deletes anything.
#
# Why the watchdog is on the MACHINE's clock and not on Hermes' clock: the
# gateway's own clock stops when the gateway does, which is exactly when a
# watchdog has to run. So root's crontab carries three lines:
#   - every 5 minutes: the floor, plain shell with no AI in it. Is the gateway
#     alive? Restart it once if not.
#   - every 30 minutes: the self-check. Can the second Hermes answer one word?
#     If not, the alert says SELF-HEALING IS DOWN, the one failure a Hermes
#     that shares its sign-in with the gateway cannot otherwise see.
#   - four times a day: the second Hermes reads the logs, explains every
#     restart the floor made, and reports to Telegram only when something
#     broke or was repaired. It shares the gateway's ChatGPT sign-in (no second
#     subscription), keeps its own memory, and wears a leash that refuses
#     everything dangerous rather than asking, because nobody is there to
#     answer. Four times a day and not hourly, because every run spends the
#     reader's ChatGPT allowance, the same one the assistant works from.
# The scripts come from the open-source Hermes Self DevOps Watchdog at an
# immutable tag; the floor inside it is fetched from ITS one upstream and
# verified by hash. Nothing here is a second copy of anything.

   The watchdog is on this machine's clock. Its alerts go to the Telegram bot
   your assistant answers on, once that is connected, and only when something
   broke, was repaired, or when the second Hermes cannot answer at all. The
   one-line installer checks that second Hermes once, after the sign-in.
