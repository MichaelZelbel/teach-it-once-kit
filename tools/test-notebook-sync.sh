# The two sync arrows and their runner: what must stay quiet, and what must never happen.
#
# WHY THIS FILE IS HERE. tools/notebook-sync.py, tools/world-pull.py and hub-notebook-sync
# are what Chapter 26 means by the notebook keeping itself current. They run unattended,
# on a schedule, on machines whose owner never asked to see them, and that shape carries
# two promises the rest of the kit does not:
#
#   1. A reader WITHOUT a notebook must never see an error from them. Most readers never
#      connect one, and a scheduled job that complains daily about a thing you never asked
#      for is how a kit gets uninstalled. Checks 8 and 9 are that.
#   2. The runner must never push. Pulling keeps an idle machine fresh; pushing is a
#      decision, and a schedule must not make decisions. Check 7 is that.
#
# Usage: bash tools/test-notebook-sync.sh

# Decisions

- (2026-01-05) Chose one AI subscription instead of two, because the best
  tool is the one I open daily.
- 2026-02-11 Named the folder hub, so every tool calls it the same thing.

## 2026-03-01 Moved the notebook key
Why: one key, one off-switch.
