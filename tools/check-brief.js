// Refuse a morning brief that sends the reader to a file instead of handing
// them the thing.
//
//   hub-check-brief <file>        a brief about to be written or sent ("-" = stdin)
//
// Exit 1 and say exactly what to change when the text asks its reader to act
// but gives them a path instead of the thing or a link. Exit 0, silent, when
// the brief is something a person on a phone can act on.
//
// WHY. A brief that says "open skills/morning-brief/x.md and paste the text"
// reads fine on the computer where the file lives, and is a dead errand on a
// phone, in a chat app, or six months later on a machine the file never
// reached. The promise "no paths, the text rides inside the brief" was made
// in prose many times and broke every time, because prose is remembered by
// sessions and a script is not. This is the script.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES, two shapes only:
//   path     anything that looks like a file location: lead/drafts/x.md,
//            /home/you/hub/..., C:\hub\...  A "Sources:" line is the one
//            exemption: provenance is allowed to name its file, because nobody
//            is asked to open it.
//   no link  "read it", "open the draft", "skim the thread" with no https
//            address anywhere in the same brief. An instruction to read
//            something must carry the something.
//
// Links are stripped before matching, because a link is the fix, not the
// fault. The script never rewrites anything; it refuses, and the writer
// (usually your assistant, running the brief recipe) fixes the text.
