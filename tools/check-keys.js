/*
 * check-keys.js - are the keys your hub folder is carrying actually ON this computer,
 * and is any of them about to run out?
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Your hub keeps your keys locked inside the folder, so connecting a
 * service once connects it on every computer you own. There is one more step after that,
 * and it is invisible: the key has to be handed to the programs running on THIS machine.
 * "It is in the folder" and "it is on this computer" are two different facts, and only the
 * second one makes anything work. When the second one is false, nothing says so. Your
 * assistant simply behaves as though you had never connected anything.
 *
 * It never prints a key. Names, dates and counts only.
 *
 * Question 4 also handles the one kind of key that is NOT in your folder on purpose: a login
 * that belongs to one computer, written in secrets/expires.txt as NAME@the/file/it/lives/in.
 * It is counted down like any other and it is never reported as missing from the folder,
 * because it was never meant to be in there.
 *
 *   hub-check-keys              check this computer
 *   hub-check-keys --hub PATH   check a hub somewhere else
 *
 * Exit code 0 when the chain holds, 1 when it does not, so it can be put in something that
 * runs on its own if you ever want that.
