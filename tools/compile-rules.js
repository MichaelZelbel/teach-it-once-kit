#!/usr/bin/env node
// compile-rules.js - write the short list of your rules into AGENTS.md.
//
// WHAT THIS IS
// ------------
// Your rules live in `rules/`, one file per rule, and each file holds the whole story: what the
// rule is, why you gave it, and what its exceptions are. That is the version you edit.
//
// Your assistant cannot read all of that every session. So this program takes the one-line version
// of each rule (the `line:` in the file's header) and writes them all into `AGENTS.md`, between two
// markers. That block is what your assistant actually reads, every time, before anything else.
//
// You edit the files in `rules/`. You never edit the block. Run this and the block catches up.
//
// WHY IT WORKS THIS WAY
// ---------------------
// You cannot search for a rule you do not know exists. If a rule sits in a folder waiting to be
// looked up, your assistant will break it without ever knowing it was there. So rules have to
// arrive uninvited, which means they have to be in the file your assistant reads first.
//
// But a rule with its whole story is a page long, and twenty of those would crowd out everything
// else. Hence the split: the story stays in the file, one sentence goes in the block, and the block
// names the file so your assistant can open it when it matters.
//
// THE CEILING
// -----------
// The block has a size limit, and this program refuses to write past it. That refusal is the point.
// Rules accumulate: every time something goes wrong you want to add one, and nothing ever removes
// one. Past a certain size they start contradicting each other at the edges, and an assistant with
// twenty overlapping rules obeys them worse than one with eight clear ones.
//
// So when a new rule will not fit, this tells you which lines are longest and asks you to merge,
// shorten, or drop one. Raising the number is the thing it exists to stop you doing.
//
// WHY NODE AND NOT PYTHON
// -----------------------
// This was a Python program until 2026-08-21. The setup in Chapter 3 installs Git, Node.js and
// Claude Code, and it has never installed Python, so the one command the safety chapter asks a
// reader to type worked only for the readers who happened to have Python already. It was also
// printed as `python3 tools/compile-rules.py`, a path no reader has, because the installer puts
// these programs on the machine rather than in the folder. Node is on every machine this kit
// touches, and the installer already knows how to make a Windows launcher for a Node program.
//

//     hub-compile-rules             rewrite the block in AGENTS.md
//     hub-compile-rules --check     say whether it is out of date, change nothing
//
// Run it from your hub folder, or give it the folder:
//     hub-compile-rules --hub /path/to/hub
