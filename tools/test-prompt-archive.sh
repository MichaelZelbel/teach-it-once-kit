# The prompt collector: what must never reach a repository, and what must never be missed.
#
# WHY THIS FILE IS HERE AND NOT IN A HUB. The two programs in tools/ are what the book means
# by "a program fills it". They used to live in one person's private hub, and so did their
# tests. Since 2026-08-10 there is one copy of each, here, in the kit that readers install
# from, so the tests live beside the thing they test.
#
# TWO RISKS NOTHING ELSE IN THE KIT HAS. The collector WRITES, and what it writes comes from
# outside: years of conversation logs.
#
#   1. A secret written into a repository. Conversation logs are the one place a pasted key or
#      a client's name turns up by accident, and a repository is forever. Checks 11 to 14 are
#      that, and check 13 matters most: a line that still looks like a credential after
#      scrubbing must be DROPPED, never half-cleaned. Losing one prompt costs nothing.
#   2. A source that quietly reaches none of the drawer. Checks 24 to 28 are that.

# Michael's machines went quiet the same day with no error anyone would see. The starter hub
# this kit installs has never had a `memory/`, so the tool shipped broken for every new reader.
