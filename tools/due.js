/*
 * due.js - the things in your life that have a last day, and how loud to be about them.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A calendar reminder fires on a date and knows nothing else. It cannot tell
 * whether you already did the thing, so it nags you afterwards, and that is how a person learns to
 * ignore reminders. Then it stops on its last occurrence whether or not the job got done. Both
 * halves of that are why the reminder that mattered went past you.
 *
 * THE ONE IDEA: A WINDOW, NOT A DUE DATE. Every obligation stores the first day you can do it and
 * the last day you still can. How loud this gets follows how much of that window is left, as a
 * fraction, which is why ONE rule fits a job you have a week for and a tax return you have a year
 * for, with nothing to tune per item.
 *
 *   red     the last tenth, and always the last day, whatever the arithmetic says
 *   orange  the last quarter
 *   yellow  the second half
 *   green   the first half
 *
 * THE PART THAT MAKES IT NOT A TO-DO LIST. Every obligation says how your hub could tell it was
 * done WITHOUT asking you. The ones that can, close themselves the moment you act. The ones that
 * cannot say so and wait for your word, which is most of them, and that is fine. Asking the
 * question is what matters.
 *
 * NO DATE, NOT ELIGIBLE. This refuses anything without both dates, on purpose. Let undated wishes
 * in and within a month it is a to-do app you do not maintain.
 *
 *   hub-due                    everything, loudest first
 *   hub-due today              at most three, for your morning brief to read
 *   hub-due add <name> --title "..." --from YYYY-MM-DD --to YYYY-MM-DD
 *          --done-when "..." --cost "..." [--repeats monthly|yearly|"every N days"]
 *          [--self-check none|file-newer] [--self-check-arg PATH] [--link URL]
 *   hub-due done <name>        you did it
 *   hub-due drop <name> --yes  delete it, history and all
 *   hub-due check              run the self checks, close what is provably done
 *   hub-due --hub PATH         work on a hub somewhere else
 *
 * It reads secrets/expires.txt too, if you have one, so the dates your keys die are obligations
 * like everything else and you never write a date in two places.
 *
 * Exit code 0 normally, 1 when something in your folder could not be read.
