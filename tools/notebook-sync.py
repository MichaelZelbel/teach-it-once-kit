"""Push hub text files into your notebook as notes, so they can be searched by meaning.

Every note lands in a folder that mirrors where its file lives in the hub, under
a single `hub` root: see HUB_FOLDER and folder_for below. Nothing this sync
sends is left at the notebook's top level.

One way only. The files on disk stay the source of truth. Menerio holds a copy it
indexes for search and must never read facts out of, because the hub's
observations are machine-written guesses and a system that mines its own guesses
ends up citing them back as things you said. The guard that enforces that
lives in Menerio, in supabase/functions/_shared/hub-source.ts.

Usage:
    python3 tools/notebook-sync.py              show what would be sent
    python3 tools/notebook-sync.py --apply      send it

Needs MENERIO_API_KEY in the environment. The installer teaches new terminals
the credential; by hand it is:  eval "$(hub-notebook-env)"
