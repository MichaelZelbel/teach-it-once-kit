# Teach It Once - set up your hub on this Mac or Linux computer, in one line.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MichaelZelbel/teach-it-once-kit/main/install-hub.sh | bash
#
# On Windows, download HubSetup.exe from the releases page and double-click it
# instead. Different front door, same promise: one thing to run, no decisions.
#
# It works out for itself what this computer needs:
#   no hub here yet  -> makes one from starter-hub/ in this kit, the folder the
#                       book walks you through chapter by chapter
#   a hub already    -> brings it up to date and re-checks the wiring
#
# It also installs what is missing underneath (Git, Node.js, Hermes) and
# gives every machine you own one shared memory.
#
# Safe to run as many times as you like. It never deletes anything you wrote.
#
# Options are passed straight through, so this also works:
#   curl -fsSL <this url> | bash -s -- --hub ~/my-folder
#   curl -fsSL <this url> | bash -s -- --repo https://github.com/you/your-hub.git
#
# This file is deliberately tiny. The work lives in kit-bootstrap, the small
# public repository that holds the install steps shared with the other kits, so
# the same code is not maintained in two places:
